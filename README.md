# Code 301 | Week 3 (Labs 11 - 14)

## Project Name: The Book App

## Overview

<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This app is a basic full-stack CRUD application that will return lists of books from the Google Books API based on the search terms entered by the user; add books to a database and then render those books from a PostgreSQL database; and allow users to add, edit, and delete books from their "shelf."

We've built this app to fulfill the requirements of Code Fellows 301, labs 11 through 14.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with GET and POST routes for the book resource. -->

## Reflections

- The fifteen-minute rule applies to everyone.
- .show() is the opposite of .hide().
- We remember more than we think we do.
