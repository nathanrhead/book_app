# Code 301 | Week 3 (Labs 11 - 14)

## Project Name: The Book App

## Overview

This app is a basic full-stack CRUD application that will return lists of books from the Google Books API based on the search terms entered by the user; add books to a database and then render those books from a PostgreSQL database; and allow users to add, edit, and delete books from their "shelf."

We've built this app to fulfill the requirements of Code Fellows 301, labs 11 through 14.

## Reflections

- The fifteen-minute rule applies to everyone.
- .show() is the opposite of .hide().
- We remember more than we think we do.
